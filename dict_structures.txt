Example Queries:
Show me all of the areas that have galvanic corrosion on critical areas that have not
been resolved in the last 30 days.
	Translates to: F1=K2 && F2=K1 && F3=K0 && F4>=V(Today-30)

F1=K2 && F2=K1 && F3=K0 && F4>=V(Today-30)
corrosion_type=K2 && risk_level=K1 && res_status=K1 && timestamp=K2

corrosion_type {
   K1 : “Acidic”,
   K2 : “Galvanic”
}

risk_level {
   K1 : “Critical”,
   K2 : "High",
   K3 : "Moderate",
   K4 : "Low",
   K5 : "Minimal"
}

res_status {
   K1 : “unresolved”,
   K2 : “in_progress”,
   K3 : “resolved”
}


can’t ask for something in the future
Need to be able to go far back, 30 days, so maybe find a way to subtract days from current timestamp
need to standardize the 
"""
from datetime import date

today = date.today()
print(today) 
"""

timestamp {
   K1 : “today”,
   K2 : “yesterday”
}
